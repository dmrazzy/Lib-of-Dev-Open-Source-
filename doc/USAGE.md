# App Usage Guide

Welcome to **Lib of Dev (Open Source)**! This guide will help you make the most of your developer reference library.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first open the app, you'll see the home screen with all available programming languages displayed as cards. Each language card shows:
- Language name and icon
- Brief description
- Color-coded accent

### Navigation

The app uses a **bottom tab navigation** with three main sections:

#### 📚 Browse Tab
Your main reference library where you can:
1. **Select a Language** - Choose from 13 programming languages
2. **Pick a Category** - Each language has multiple organized categories
3. **View Code Examples** - See detailed code with explanations
4. **Copy Code** - Easily copy examples to your clipboard

#### 🔍 Search Tab
Quickly find what you need:
- Search across **all languages** simultaneously
- Find code examples, functions, and syntax
- Results show language, category, and preview
- Tap any result to view full details

#### ⭐ Favorites Tab
Save your most-used references:
- Star any code example to save it
- Quick access to frequently referenced code
- Organize your personal library

## 📖 How to Use Each Feature

### Browsing Languages

1. **Tap on a language card** on the home screen
2. You'll see all categories for that language
3. Each category shows the number of items it contains
4. Tap a category to see all code examples

### Viewing Code Examples

Each code detail page includes:

- **Code Block**: The actual code example with proper formatting
- **Description**: What the code does
- **Usage Guidelines**: When and how to use it
- **Key Points**: Important notes and best practices

### Copying Code

1. Navigate to any code example
2. Tap the **"📋 Copy"** button at the top of the code block
3. The code is copied to your clipboard
4. Paste it directly into your IDE or text editor

### Searching

1. Go to the **Search tab**
2. Type your query (e.g., "async", "loop", "array")
3. Results appear instantly
4. Each result shows:
   - Language and category
   - Code title
   - Brief description
   - Code preview
5. Tap any result to view full details

### Saving Favorites

1. View any code example
2. Tap the **star icon** (☆) in the top-right corner
3. The star fills (⭐) to show it's saved
4. Access all favorites in the **Favorites tab**
5. Tap again to remove from favorites

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

### Quick Navigation
- Use the **back button** to return to previous screens
- The app remembers your last position
- Breadcrumbs show your current location

### Effective Searching
- Search by concept: "loop", "function", "class"
- Search by keyword: "async", "await", "map"
- Search is case-insensitive
- Searches across code, descriptions, and usage notes

### Organizing Your Learning
- **Star basics first**: Save fundamental concepts you often forget
- **Category by language**: Explore one language fully before moving to another
- **Compare across languages**: Search for the same concept across languages

### Best Practices
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: All code examples are designed to be copy-paste ready
- **Context Matters**: Always read the description and usage notes
- **Adapt to Your Needs**: Examples are templates - modify them for your use case
